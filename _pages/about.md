## Research Interest
My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of **computer graphics**, **computer vision**, and **machine learning**, particularly in 3D / 4D scene understanding and reconstruction, any type of image / video generation, or related software for smartphones.I'm fortunate enough to do research with prof. [Abe Davis](http://abedavis.com/).

This summer I'm doing a research intership with prof. Davis at Cornell as a part of the [CSURP/BURE research program](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/uresch/cornell-bowers-cis-undergraduate-research-experience-bure).
